# FCC-Project-Tribute-Page

A freeCodeCamp project where the student fulfills several different user stories and passes a collection of tests. Part of the Responsive Web Design certification.

The goal is to build a simple web page in tribute to a chosen person or character. Emphasis on connecting elements of the page to a corresponding id in CSS and responsively resizing an image. I threw in a few extra things for fun, such as a responsive header and a tribute quote that "pops" out of the page with rounded borders and a box shadow.
